    "# What is Thin Layer Chromatography?\n",
    "Thin layer Chromatography, also known as TLC,  is an analytical method to separate and identify compounds or mixtures. Compounds are placed near the bottom of the silica gel, which acts as the stationary phase. The plate is then dipped in the solvent, which acts as the mobile phase. Compounds then travel up to different points on the plate based on their interactions with the stationary and mobile phases respectively.\n",

    "Do take note that the relative distance a compound travels on the plate in relation to the mobile phase's travel distance is measured by the **Rf value** . \n",

    "Think of it this way, imagine a running track made of a magnet, with some runners wearing metallic shoes and others wearing rubber shoes. On this track, those with metallic shoes will run slower than those in rubber shoes. This concept is similar to how TLC works. The silica gel (race track) is an adsorbent material that attracts polar molecules. The stronger the interaction between the compound and the silica gel (similar to the magnetic shoes and the magnetic track), the more difficult it is for the compound to move up the silica gel, allowing us to separate compounds based on their **polarity.**\n",
